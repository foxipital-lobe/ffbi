# Fabulously Foxed Befunge Interpreter (FFBI)

Yet another Befunge 98 interpreter.
Almost Mycology compliant (soon).

_TODO_
* t, i, o, and =
* get command line args and environment variables returned by y actually working (currently returns '\0\0' for both)
* implement some fingerprints?
* user input

_IMPLEMENTATION NOTES_
* There is no handprint (returns 0)
* t, i, o, and = are not supported (yet)
* No fingerprints currently supported (yet)
* No user input supported (yet)
